## [Project 1: Process Scheduler](https://github.com/aminaopio/csce4600/tree/main/Project1)

This project builds a simple process scheduler that takes in a file containing example processes, and outputs a schedule based on different schedule types:
- [x] FCFS (already done)
- [ ] SJF [preemptive]
- [ ] SJF Priority scheduling [preemptive]
- [ ] RR [always preemptive]
