## [Project 1: Process Scheduler](https://github.com/aminaopio/csce4600/tree/main/Project1)
To run, enter "**go run main.go example_processes.csv**" in the terminal.

This project builds a simple process scheduler that takes in a file containing example processes, and outputs a schedule based on different schedule types:
- [x] FCFS (already done)
- [x] SJF [preemptive]
- [x] SJF Priority scheduling [preemptive]
- [ ] RR [always preemptive] produces error: "panic: runtime error: index out of range [3] with length 3"
